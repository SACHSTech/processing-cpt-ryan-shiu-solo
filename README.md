# Program Title (edit this)

Put your program description here.

Objective of the game (what's the point of playing)
The objective of the game is to try and beat your previous high score each game. In the game, there are good icons (candy) falling and bad icons falling (red circles). The goal is to collect only the candy icons and avoid the red circles. There are also gold coins that spawn and fall from time to time. It is important that you pay attention to this because these icons are “must hits”. If you successfully hit the gold coin, you stay alive but everytime you miss one, a life is lost.

Gameplay mechanics and/or user interaction
In order to move the main character (Kirby and the block underneath) the left or right arrow key must be pressed. This is how the user is able to dodge and collect icons in order to gain points. When the user loses, a “game over” screen appears and they are able to click “Play Again” with their mouse in order to restart the game. 

Scoring (if any)
Everytime the user collides with a piece of candy, the score goes up by one point. But if they collide with a red circle, the user will lose 1 of their 3 lives (heart icons in the top right will disappear). When the user collides with a gold coin, it adds 5 points to the score but if the gold coin hits the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life.

Limitations (any important things your program doesn't do that is worth noting)
Other keys on the keyboard and up and down arrow keys do not move the player.
